* Building Blocks of Matter
  * \[ \left| Q_{proton} \right| = \left| Q_{electron} \right| \] 
  * \[ N_{protons} = N_{electrons} \]
  * The magnitude of the charge of the proton is exactly equal to the magnitude of the charge on the electron. Since there are equal numbers of electrons and protons in an atom, atoms are electrically neutral.
  * Types of material
     * Conductor
         * Charge carriers [the electrons] are totally free to move.
         * Materials such as metals
     * Insulator
         * Charges are fixed and cannot move.
         * Materials such as plastics

* Questions
  * The nucleus of a Helium atom has a charge equal to twice the proton's charge. Let \[F_N\] denote the magnitude of the force the Helium nucleus exerts on one of the electrons in a Helium atom, and let \[F_e\] denote the magnitude of the force one electron in the Helium atom exerts on the Helium nucleus.
     * \[F_N = F_e \]
     * Even though the charges are not the same, the magnitude of the forces must be equal. The dominant force between the nucleus and the electron is the Coulomb force and this force is proportional to the product of the charges. Therefore, the magnitudes of \[F_N\] and \[F_e\] must be equal since the order in the multiplication doesn't matter.
There is a more general reason that these forces must be equal, however: they comprise a Newton's third law interaction pair which means that their magnitudes are the same and their directions are opposite.
