## Flux from Uniformly Charged Rod

An infinitely long charged rod has uniform charge density of \[\lambda\], 
and passes through a cylinder (gray). The cylinder in case 2 has twice 
the radius and half the length compared to the cylinder in case 1.

Compare the magnitude of the flux, \[\phi\], through the surface of the cylinder in both cases.

* \[ \phi_1 = 2 \phi_2\]
  * We are integrating over half the distance to compute the flux.

## Flux from Point Charge Through Surfaces of Sphere

A positive charge (blue) is contained inside a spherical shell (black).

Consider two small surface elements on the shell surface \[d_A\] and \[d_B\], 
located on opposite side of the shell.

### 1)
How does the electric flux through the two surface elements, \[d \phi_A\] and 
\[d \phi_B\] change when the charge is moved from position 1 to position 2?

* \[d \phi_A\] increases and \[d \phi_B\] decreases.
  * The positive charge is closer to \[d_A\] in position 2.

### 2)
How does the flux \[ \phi_E\] through the entire surface change when the charge 
is moved from position 1 to position 2?

* Both \[d \phi_A\] and \[d \phi_B\] do not change.
  * The charge is still contained withing the surface in both cases.
