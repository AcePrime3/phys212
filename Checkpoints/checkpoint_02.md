## Field Directions

[[images/checkpoint_02_field_directions.png]]

Two equal, but opposite charges are placed on the \[x\] axis. The 
positive charge is placed at to the left of the origin and the negative 
charge is placed to the right, as shown in the figure above.

### 1)
What is the direction of the electric field at point \[A\]?

* Right
  * The opposite charges cancel along the \[y\] axis while \[+Q\] pushes 
    along the positive \[x\] axis and \[-Q\] pulls allong the positive
    \[x\] axis.

### 2)
What is the direction of the electric field at point \[B\]?

* Left
  * Although the \[+Q\] charge is pushing to the right along the positive \[x\] axis 
    at poiont \[B\], the \[-Q\] is pulling to the left along the negative \[x\] axis
    and hence the direction of the electric field at point \[B\] is leftward.


## Magnitude of Field from Two Charges

In which of the two cases is the magnitude of the electric field at the point labeled 
\[A\] the largest?

* The magnitudes are equal
  * In both cases, the point is being acted on by forces in perpendicular directions.
    Case 1, the charge being pushed in along the positive \[x\] axis by \[+Q\] and 
    pulled along the negative \[y\] axis by \[-Q\].  Case 2, the charge is being pushed along
    the postive \[x\] axis by the upper right \[+Q\] charge and pushed along the positive
    \[y\] axis by the bottom right \[+Q\] charge.
