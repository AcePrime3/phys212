CheckPoint: Electric Potential Energy

## Lecture Thoughts

Why are the variables continually changing?

Specifically:
* PreLecture: Done by Coulomb Force
  * You introduce Coulombs law as \[\vec F_E = \frac{ 1}{ 4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{ Q q}{ r^2}\hat{ r}\], siting the charges in terms of  \[Q\] and \[q\].
  * You then introduce the conservation formula \[W_{AB} = \frac{ q_1 q_2}{ 4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \left( \frac{ 1}{ r_A} - \frac{ 1}{ r_B}\right)\]
  * Why did you change these, this is just confusing and unnecessary.
* PreLecture: Question 1
  * You state the question in terms of \[M_1\], \[M_2\], \[R_a\], \[R_b\].  
  * The conservation formula \[W_{AB} = \frac{ q_1 q_2}{ 4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \left( \frac{ 1}{ r_A} - \frac{ 1}{ r_B}\right)\] is defined with points \[A\] and \[B\] with distances \[r_A\] and \[r_B\].
  * Why did you change these, this is just confusing and unnecessary.
* PreLecture: Electric Potential Energy
  * While explaining where the equation for Electric Potential Energy came from you have the following irregularites:
    * Jump from \[U_{AB} \Rightarrow r_A, r_B\] to \[U_{r_0 B} \Rightarrow r_0 r_B\]
      * \[\Delta U_{A B} = \frac{ Q q}{ 4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \left(\frac{ 1}{ r_B} - \frac{ 1}{ r_A}\right)\] 
      * \[\Delta U_{r_0 B} = \frac{ Q q}{ 4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \left(\frac{ 1}{ r_B} - \frac{ 1}{ r_0}\right)\] 
    * Jump from \[U_{\infty B} \Rightarrow infty r_B\] to \[U_{\infity r} \Rightarrow \infty r\] 
      * \[\Delta U_{\infty B} = \frac{ Q q}{ 4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \left(\frac{ 1}{ r_B}\right)\] 
      * \[\Delta U_{\infty r} = \frac{ Q q}{ 4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \left(\frac{ 1}{ r}\right)\] 
  * This expression are **not** regular!
* PreLecture: Question 2
  * distance in now in terms of \[d\]
  * charges switch from \[q_1, q_2\] to just \[-q\] and \[+q\]
  * Where is the consistency, why do I constantly have to unnecessarily infer meaning out these problems.  This does not help people learn it just make them approach the problems as if physics is magic.


The laws of physics able to be defined as a [regular language](1).  The mannor in which formulas are presented requires unnecessary interpretation of what the variables actually mean.  
If the material could maintain consistency amongst these formulas, these long winded explanations about what the formulas are and how they are derived would be unnecessary.  The material of this course is trivial, the way it is presented and manor in which the questions are formulated makes learning the content arbitrarily difficult.
