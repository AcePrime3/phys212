# Electric Current

## Two Resistors 
Two cylindrical resistors are made from the same material 
and are equal in length. The first resistor has diameter \[d\], 
and the second resistor has diameter \[2 d\].

### 1)
If the same current flows through both, 
compare the voltage across the two resistors:

* \[V_1 > V_2\]

### 2)
Two cylindrical resistors are made from the same material 
and are equal in diameter. The first resistor has length \[L\], 
and the second resistor has length \[2 L\].

If the same current flows through both, 
compare the voltage across the two resistors:

* \[V_1 < V_2\]

## Resistor Network
Three resistors are connected to a battery with emf \[V\] as shown. 
The resistances of the resistors are all the same, i.e. 
\[R_1 = R2 = R3 = R\].

### 1)
Compare the current through R2 with the current through R3:

* \[I_2 = I_3\]

### 2)
Compare the current through R1 with the current through R2:

* \[\frac{ I_1}{ I_2} = 2\]

### 3)
Compare the current through R1 with the current through R2:

* \[V_2 = V_3 < V\]

### 4)
Compare the the voltage across R1 with the voltage across R2.

* \[ V_1 = 2 V_2 = V\]
