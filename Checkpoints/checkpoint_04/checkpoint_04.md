# CheckPoint: Gauss' Law

## Gaussian Surface Choice
You are told to use Gauss' Law to calculate 
the electric field at a distance \[R\] away from 
a charged cube of dimension \[a\]. Which of the 
following Gaussian surfaces is best suited for 
this purpose?

* This field cannot be calculated using Gauss' law
  * I don't know

## Charged Spherical Shell
A charged spherical insulating shell has inner radius \[a\] 
and outer radius \[b\]. The charge density on the shell is \[\rho\].

What is the magnitude of the \[E\]-field at a distance \[r\] away 
from the center of the shell where \[r < a\]?
