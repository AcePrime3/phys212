\[F_{1 \rightarrow 2} = -G \frac{ m_1 m_2}{ r_{12}^2} \hat r_{12}\]

For particle of equal mass \[M\] are fixe at the corners of a square 
with sides of length \[a\].  A fith particle has mass \[m\] and moves 
under the gravitational forces fo the other four

# (a) 

Find the **\[x\]-compnent and \[y\]-component** of the net gravitational 
force on \[m\] due to the other foure masses when \[m\] is located at
the center of the square [lef-handed figure]

\[\overrightarrow F  = 0\] 

Each of the masses pull in equal and oposite directions.
