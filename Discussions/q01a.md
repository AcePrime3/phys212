A point particle of mass \[m\] travels freely in the 
\[x\]-direction with uniform velocity \[v_0\].  At \[x = 0 \], 
it enters a region between two plates oriented perpendicular 
to the \[y-axis\]; the plate spacing is \[w\], and the plate length
in the \[x\]-direction is \[L\].  The particle enters on the 
mid-plane \[y = 0\]. While between the plates, it experiances 
a constant, spatially uniform force \[F\] in the \[+y\]-direction.
After exiting the plates the particle again moves freely.
