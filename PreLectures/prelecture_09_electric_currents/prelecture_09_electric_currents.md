* Electrodynamics
  * \[I \equiv \frac{ d q}{ d t}\]
* Ohm's Law 
  * \[J = \sigma E\]
* Resistance

## Current: Qualitative Description
* \[I = \frac{ d q}{ d t}\]
  * SI Units \[ A = \frac{ C}{ S}\] or Ampere equals coulomb per second

## Current: Quantitative Description
* Current Density \[J\]
  * \[J \equiv \frac{ I}{ A}\] where \[I\] is the total current 
    and \[A\] is the area of a circular section of the cylinder.
  * \[J \equiv \frac{ I}{ A} = \] where \[n_e\] is the number 
    conduction electrons per unit volume, \[e\] is the charge 
    on a single electron, \[v_{drift}\] is the average volocity 
    of the conduction electrons.
      * \[n_e = N_A \frac{ \rho_{mass}}{ M}\]
  * Ohm's Law
    * \[J \propto E\]
    * \[J = \sigma E\], where \[\sigma\] is the conductivity 
      of the material
    * \[v_{drift} = \frac{ \sigma}{ n_e e } E\]
      * directed towrd the positive end of the battery
