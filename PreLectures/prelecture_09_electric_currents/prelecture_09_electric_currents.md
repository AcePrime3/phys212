## Current: Qualitative Description
* \[I = \frac{ d q}{ d t}\]
  * SI Units \[ A = \frac{ C}{ S}\] or Ampere equals coulomb per second

## Current: Quantitative Description
* Current Density \[J\]
  * \[J \equiv \frac{ I}{ A}\] where \[I\] is the total current 
    and \[A\] is the area of a circular section of the cylinder.
  * \[J \equiv \frac{ I}{ A} = \] where \[n_e\] is the number 
    conduction electrons per unit volume, \[e\] is the charge 
    on a single electron, \[v_{drift}\] is the average volocity 
    of the conduction electrons.
      * \[n_e = N_A \frac{ \rho_{mass}}{ M}\]
  * Ohm's Law
    * \[J \propto E\]
    * \[J = \sigma E\], where \[\sigma\] is the conductivity 
      of the material
    * \[v_{drift} = \frac{ \sigma}{ n_e e } E\]
      * directed towrd the positive end of the battery

## Resistance

[[resistance.png]]
* \[J = \sigma \frac{ V}{ L}\]
* Since 
  * \[J \equiv \frac{ I}{ A} = \sigma \frac{ V}{ L}\]
  * \[R \equiv \frac{ V}{ I}\]
* We find 
  * \[R = \frac{ 1}{ \sigma} \frac{ L}{ A}\]
  * \[R = \rho \frac{ L}{ A}\]

# Question 1
Two cylindrical resistors are made from the same material. 
The shorter one has length \[L\] and diamater \[D\]. The longer 
one has length \[16L\] and diameter \[4D\].

How do their resistances compare?

[[q1.png]]

* The resistance of the longer one is the same as the 
  resisitance of the shorter one.
  * The resistance of each is proportional to its length 
    divided by its area. Since the longer one has 16 times 
    the length but also has 16 times the area 
    (i.e. four times the diameter), its overall resistance 
    is the same as the shorter one.
