* Questions
  * The nucleus of a Helium atom has a charge equal to twice the proton's charge. Let \[F_N\] denote the magnitude of the force the Helium nucleus exerts on one of the electrons in a Helium atom, and let \[F_e\] denote the magnitude of the force one electron in the Helium atom exerts on the Helium nucleus.
     * \[F_N = F_e \]
     * Even though the charges are not the same, the magnitude of the forces must be equal. The dominant force between the nucleus and the electron is the Coulomb force and this force is proportional to the product of the charges. Therefore, the magnitudes of \[F_N\] and \[F_e\] must be equal since the order in the multiplication doesn't matter.
There is a more general reason that these forces must be equal, however: they comprise a Newton's third law interaction pair which means that their magnitudes are the same and their directions are opposite.


  * Three charges are fixed in place as shown below. The +q charge is equidistant from the +2q and -q charges. ![physprob](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11444220/00/Screen%20Shot%202012-06-10%20at%209.55.16%20PM.png) Which of the vectors shown most closely represents the total force on the +q charge?
     * b
     * To find the total force on \[+q\] charge we need to add the force on it from the \[+2q\] charge (\[F_2\]) and the force on it from the \[-q\] charge (\[F_1\]) as shown in the diagram. ![physprob_ans](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11444220/00/Screen%20Shot%202012-06-10%20at%209.55.27%20PM.png)
        * Note that \[F_2\] is twice as long as F1 since the distances from \[+q\] to \[+2q\] and to \[-q\] are the same, but the magnitude of \[+2q\] is twice that of \[-q\]. \[F_2\] points to the right since \[+2q\] exerts a repulsive force on \[+q\]. \[F_1\] points down since \[-q\] exerts an attractive force on \[+q\]. The total force (\[F_2\]) on \[+q\] is found by taking the vector sum as shown.

  * Two Charges \[ q = + 1 \mu \text{C} \] and \[ Q = +10 \mu \text{C}\] are placed near each other as shown in the figure ![figure](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11444220/00/Screen%20Shot%202012-06-10%20at%2010.04.03%20PM.png)1) Which of the following diagrams best depicts the forces acting on the charges?
     * C
         * Charge \[q\] is \[frac{ 1}{ 10}\] the magnitude of charge \[Q\] but the charges have an equal and oposite effect on one another.  Therefore, the \[F_{qQ} = F_{Qq}\]

  * Consider the two cases shown below. In both cases a central charge q has two charges of equal magnitude at equal distances above and below it. In Case 1 the signs of the two outer charges is opposite, and in Case 2 they are both positive. You are not told the sign of the charge in the center q.  ![figure](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11444220/00/Screen%20Shot%202012-06-11%20at%202.14.27%20AM.png)   In which Case is the magnitude of the net force on the center charge bigger?
     * Case 1
         * In case2 the force of the two \[+Q\] charges cancel one another out as the are push the charge equally in opposite directions.  In case1 \[+Q\] is pushing the charge downward and the \[-Q\] is pulling the charge downward, in turn producing a higher net force on the center charge.

  * A positive charge \[Q\] is placed at the origin. Four other positive charges are placed on a circle in the \[x-y\] plane centered on \[Q\] as shown. The top charge is located on the \[y\] axis and has a magnitude of \[3q\]. The three bottom charges are symmetric about the y axis as shown and each has magnitude \[q\]. ![figure](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11444220/00/Screen%20Shot%202012-06-11%20at%202.22.49%20AM.png)
     * Which of the following statements best describes \[F_X\], the \[x\] component of the net force on the charge at the origin?
         * \[F_x = 0\]
         * The forces along the x-axis sum to zero.
     * For the collection of charges shown in the above problem, which of the following statements best describes \[F_Y\], the \[y\] component of the net force on the charge at the origin?
         * \[F_Y < 0 \]
         * While all force of the \[3q\] is directed along the negative \[y\] axis, some of the force exerted on \[Q\] by two of the \[q\] charges is directed along the \[x\] axis and therefore \[F_N\] is along the negative \[y\] axis.
