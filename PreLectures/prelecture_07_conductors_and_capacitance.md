# Conductors and Capacitance

## Overview

* Today will extend our study of electric potential to
  * Conductors
  * Capacitance
      * We will introduce this topic
* Last time we introduced Electric Potential
  * \[\Delta V_{A \rightarrow B} = -\int\limits_{A}^{B}{ \vec E \cdot d \vec l}
  * All example shown had fixed charge distrobutions, today we will 
    introduce conductors without a fixed charge distrobution.
        * Conductors where the charges are free to move
