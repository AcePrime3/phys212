# Conductors and Capacitance

## Overview

* Today will extend our study of electric potential to
  * Conductors
  * Capacitance
      * We will introduce this topic
* Last time we introduced Electric Potential
  * \[\Delta V_{A \rightarrow B} = -\int\limits_{A}^{B}{ \vec E \cdot d \vec l}\]
  * All example shown had fixed charge distrobutions, today we will 
    introduce conductors without a fixed charge distrobution.
        * Conductors where the charges are free to move
* After discussing non-uniform charge distrobution in a conductor, we go on to discuss capacitance
  * Specifically we discuss parallel plates 
  * \[C \equiv \frac{ Q}{ \Delta V}\]
    * Field betwee plates \[E = \frac{ Q}{ \varepsilon_0 A}\]

## Conductors and Equipotentials

* \[V_B - V_A = -\int\limits_{A}^B}{ \vec E \cdot d \vec l}\]
* \[V_B - V_A = 0\]
  * Since \[\vec E = 0\] everywhere within the conductor
  * This implies that the entire conductor it self is an _equipotential_
