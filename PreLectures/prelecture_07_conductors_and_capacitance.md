# Conductors and Capacitance

## Overview

* Today will extend our study of electric potential to
  * Conductors
  * Capacitance
      * We will introduce this topic
* Last time we introduced Electric Potential
  * \[\Delta V_{A \rightarrow B} = -\int\limits_{A}^{B}{ \vec E \cdot d \vec l}\]
  * All example shown had fixed charge distrobutions, today we will 
    introduce conductors without a fixed charge distrobution.
        * Conductors where the charges are free to move
* After discussing non-uniform charge distrobution in a conductor, we go on to discuss capacitance
  * Specifically we discuss parallel plates 
  * \[C \equiv \frac{ Q}{ \Delta V}\]
    * Field betwee plates \[E = \frac{ Q}{ \varepsilon_0 A}\]

## Conductors and Equipotentials

* \[V_B - V_A = -\int\limits_{A}^B}{ \vec E \cdot d \vec l}\]
* \[V_B - V_A = 0\]
  * Since \[\vec E = 0\] everywhere within the conductor
  * This implies that the entire conductor it self is an _equipotential_

* When the conductor is circularly symmetric, the field lines are perpendicular to the surface

* When we change the shape such that it is no longer circularly symmetric the charge
density redistributes such that we have varying points of charge density

## Question 1

A solid elliptical conductor with a net charge \[Q\] is surrounded by 
a hollow spherical conductor with net charge \[-Q\]. Points \[a\] and \[c\] 
are on the outer surface of the inner conductor, and points \[b\] and \[d\] 
are on the inner surface of the outer conductor as shown.

Compare \[V_{ab}\], the magnitude of the potential difference between 
points \[a\] and \[b\], to \[V_{cd}\], the magnitude of the potential 
difference between points \[c\] and \[d\].

* \[V_{ab} = V_{cd}\]
  * Since each conductor is an equipotential, the potential difference 
    between any point on the inner conductor and any point on the outer 
    conductor has to be the same.

## Equipotential Example

* Consider two conducting spheres which are seprerated by a large distance
  and have radius' \[R_A\] and \[R_B = 4 R_A\]
