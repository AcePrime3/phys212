# Electric Fields

## Overview

* Coulomb's Law
  * \[ {\overrightarrow F_{ iq}} = k \frac{ {{Q_i}{q}}}{ {r_{ iq}^2}} {\hat r_{ iq}}\]
* Superpossition
  * \[ {\overrightarrow F = {\sum\limits_i \overrightarrow F_{iq}} = kq {\sum\limits_i \frac{ Q_i}{ r_{iq}^2} \hat r_{iq}\]
* Point Charge
  * \[ E = k \frac{ Q}{ r^2} \]
* Infinite Line of Charge
  * \[ E = 2k \frac{\lambda }{ r} \]

## Electric Fields

* Electric Field
  * \[{\overrightarrow E \equiv \frac{ \overrightarrow F}{ q} \]
  * \[{\overrightarrow E_1 \equiv \frac{ \overrightarrow F_{12}}{ q_2} = k \frac{ q_1}{ r^2} \hat r\]
  * \[{\overrightarrow E_Q \equiv \frac{ \overrightarrow F}{ q} = k \frac{Q}{ r^2} \hat r\]

## Example: A point Charge

* Electric Field
  * \[{\overrightarrow E_Q \equiv \frac{ \overrightarrow F}{ q} = k \frac{Q}{ r^2} \hat r\]

* A single point charge creates a perfectly cylindrically symmetrical field.

## Question 1

In the diagrams below, the magnitude and direction of the electric field is represented 
by the length and direction of the blue arrows. Which of the diagrams best represents 
the electric field from a **negative charge**?

* (d)
  * The only difference between the field from the positive charge and the negative 
charge is that the direction changes. Namely, the field always points away from the 
positive charge, since the force it would exert on another positive charge would be 
repulsive, directed away from the initial charge. The field always points towards 
from the negative charge, since the force it would exert on a positive charge would 
be attractive, directed towards the initial charge.

## The Electric Dipole
* Two opposite charges of equal magnitude.
* Determinign the force at some point \[P\].
  * Calculate the electric fields separately at point \[P\] and then take the
vector sum.

## Question 2

An electric dipole (two opposite charges of equal magnitude) is oriented along the 
\[y\] axis as shown. You are not told which charge is positive, but you know the 
electric field at a point \[P\] on the \[y\] axis is as shown by the green arrow.

If the bottom charge is removed, which of the following best describes what happens 
to the electric field at \[P\]?

* The magnitude increases and the direction stays the same.
  * Since both charges have the same magnitude, and since point \[P\] is closer to 
    the top charge than to the bottom charge, the direction of \[E\] at point \[P\] tells 
    us that the top charge is positve and the bottom charge and that their field 
    add as shown to give the total field at \[P\]:
  * Since the contributions to the field at \[P\] from the positive and negative 
    charges partially cancel when both chargs are present, removing the bottom 
    charge will increase the total field.
