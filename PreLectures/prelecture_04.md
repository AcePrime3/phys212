# Gauss' Law

## Overview

* \[ \oint\limits_{surface}{ \vec E \cdot d \vec A} = \frac{ q_{enclosed}}{ \epsilon_0} \]
* First discuss solid insulator followed by 
* Solid Conductor
* Cylindrical Conductor
* Infinite Sheet of Charge

## Gauss' Law and Symmetry

* Casses with Symmetry \[ E\] may be pulled out of Gauss' Law such that
  * \[E \oint\limits_{surface}{ d A} = \frac{ q_{enclosed}}{ \epsilon_0}\]

## Question

Consider a sphere, an infinitely long cylinder, and a plane of infinite length 
and width (a, b and c below). Imagine that you can hover above each one in your 
own personal helicopter. In which case do you have the most freedom to move about 
without your view of the object changing? In other words, for each case consider 
if there are directions that you can move in without the objects distance or 
orientation, relative to you, changing.

* The infinite plane offers the most freedom to move without your view changing.
  * You can move in two dimensions - any direction parallel to the plane - as you 
    fly above it, and it will still look exactly the same from your perspective. 
    By the same kind of reasoning you will see that you can move in just one 
    dimension above the cylinder - parallel to its length - if you want it to 
    look the same, and you can not move at all above the sphere without your 
    view changing.
