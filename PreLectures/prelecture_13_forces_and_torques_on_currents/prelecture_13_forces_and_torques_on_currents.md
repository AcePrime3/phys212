# Forces and Torques on Currents

## Overview
* Continue study of magnetism by studying the forces and torques
  exerted on currents carrying wires and magnetic fields.
  * First, calculate the forces on strait and curved wires in
    constant magnetic fields
  * Next, calculate the torque on a closed loop of current in a magnetic
    field.
  * Next, introduce the concept of the dipole moment.
  * Last, we use this dipole moment to define the _potential_ energy that is associated
    with a current loop located in a region of space that contains a magnetic field.

## Forces on a Straight Current Segment
* Last time, we learned charges moving in a uniform magnetic field experience a force that
  is proportional to the charge, magnetic field, and component of the velocity perpendicular
  to the magnetic field.  The direction is perpendicular to both the magnetic field and
  the velocity.
* Now, we discuss what happens when a current carrying wire is placed in a region of space
  that contains a magnetic field.
  * [[cur_wire_mag_field.png]]
  * Current is composed of charges in motion we expect that there will be some sort of
    force exerted on the wire.
  * [[cur_wire_mag_field_1.png]]
  * Using the right hand rule we determine the force to be in the upward direction
  * Now calculate the magnitude of this force.
  * \[\vec F = I \vec L \times \vec B\]
      * \[\vec F = \sum\limits_{i}{ \vec F_i} 
        = q \sum\limits_{i}{ \vec v_i \times \vec B\]
      * \[= q (N \vec v_{avg}) \times \vec B \]
          * \[N = n A L\] where \[n\] is the number of charges carriers per volume in the wire
            and \[A L\] is the volume of the wire.
      * \[= q n A L \vec v_{avg} \times \vec B\]
          * \[I = n A q v_{avg}\]
      * The net force is vector sum of the force acting on each of the individual charges carried through the wire.
