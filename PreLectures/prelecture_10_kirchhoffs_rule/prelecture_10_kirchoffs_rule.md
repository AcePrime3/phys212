# Kirchhoff's Rules

## Overview
* Start with a brief overview of the devices we will using
  * Switch

  * Battery
      * [[battery.png]]
  * Capacitor
      * [[capacitor.png]]
  * Resistor
      * [[resistor.png]]
* Then we will introduce _Kirchoff's Rule_
  * \[\sum \Delta V_n = 0\]
      * any closed loop
  * \[\sum I_in = \sum I_out\]
      * at any node
* Close by modeling a real battery as an ideal battery in series

## Review of Electrical Devices
* Battery
  * Maintain a constant potential difference across their terminals
      * sometimes this potential difference is referred to as the EMF
      * \[EMF \equiv \varepsilon = V_b\]
  * [[battery.png]]
* Capacitors
  * Capacitors store charge
  * \[V_C = \frac{ Q}{ C}\]
      * the voltage drop accross capacitors is equal to excess charge
        \[Q\] on one plate divided by \[C\] it's capacitance.
      * We speak about capacitors in terms of the rate of change
        across it's plates.
