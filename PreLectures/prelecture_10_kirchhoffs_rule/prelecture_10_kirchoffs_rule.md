# Kirchhoff's Rules

## Overview
* Start with a brief overview of the devices we will using
  * Switch
      * [[switch.png]]
  * Battery
      * [[battery.png]]
  * Capacitor
      * [[capacitor.png]]
  * Resistor
      * [[resistor.png]]
* Then we will introduce _Kirchoff's Rule_
  * \[\sum \Delta V_n = 0\]
      * any closed loop
  * \[\sum I_in = \sum I_out\]
      * at any node
* Close by modeling a real battery as an ideal battery in series
