# Electric Flux and Field Lines

## Overview
* Gauss' Law
  * Inside a spherical surface 
     * \[ Flux = \frac{ Q}{ \epsilon_0} \]
  * Outside a spherical surface
     * \[ Flux = 0\]

## Electric Field Lines

* Electric Field
  * \[ E = \kappa \frac{ q}{ r^2}\]
       * \[ E = \frac{ 1}{ 4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{ q}{ r^2}\]
* Density of Field Lines
  * \[ D = \frac{ N}{4 \pi r^2}\]
     * \[ N \equiv \frac{ q}{ \epsilon_0}\]
     * \[ E = \frac{ N}{ 4 \pi r^2}\]
* Surface Area of a Sphere
  * \[ A = 4 \pi r^2\]

## Electric Flux
* Electric Flux
  * \[ \phi = \vec E \cdot \vec A\]
  * \[ \phi \equiv \int\limits_{\text{surface}}{ \vec E \cdot d \vec A}\]
  * The quantity the counts the number of field lines that pass 
    through a surface.

## Question 1

Consider the same point charge at the center of two different spherical 
surfaces, one having a radius three times as big as the other as shown below.

Compare the electric flux through each of the spheres.
* The flux through the two spheres is the same
  *  We just learned that for a simple spherical configuration the flux is 
    just the product of the electric field \[E\] with the surface area A of the 
    sphere. Since \[E\] decreases as \[ \frac{ 1}{ R^2}\] and the surface area 
    increases as \[R^2\], their product remains constant. This answer can also 
    be understood in terms of our graphical representation in which the flux 
    is a measure of the number of lines leaving the surface. Clearly, the same 
    number of lines leave the surface of any sphere centered on the charge.
