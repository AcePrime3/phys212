# Electric Flux and Field Lines

## Overview
* Gauss' Law
  * Inside a spherical surface 
     * \[ Flux = \frac{ Q}{ \varepsilon_0} \]
  * Outside a spherical surface
     * \[ Flux = 0\]

## Electric Field Lines

* Electric Field
  * \[ E = \kappa \frac{ q}{ r^2}\]
       * \[ E = \frac{ 1}{ 4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{ q}{ r^2}\]
* Density of Field Lines
  * \[ D = \frac{ N}{4 \pi r^2}\]
     * \[ N \equiv \frac{ q}{ \varepsilon_0}\]
     * \[ E = \frac{ N}{ 4 \pi r^2}\]
* Surface Area of a Sphere
  * \[ A = 4 \pi r^2\]

## Electric Flux
* Electric Flux
  * \[ \phi = \vec E \cdot \vec A\]
  * \[ \phi \equiv \int\limits_{\text{surface}}{ \vec E \cdot d \vec A}\]
  * The quantity the counts the number of field lines that pass 
    through a surface.

## Question 1

Consider the same point charge at the center of two different spherical 
surfaces, one having a radius three times as big as the other as shown below.

Compare the electric flux through each of the spheres.
* The flux through the two spheres is the same
  *  We just learned that for a simple spherical configuration the flux is 
    just the product of the electric field \[E\] with the surface area A of the 
    sphere. Since \[E\] decreases as \[ \frac{ 1}{ R^2}\] and the surface area 
    increases as \[R^2\], their product remains constant. This answer can also 
    be understood in terms of our graphical representation in which the flux 
    is a measure of the number of lines leaving the surface. Clearly, the same 
    number of lines leave the surface of any sphere centered on the charge.

## Flux Example
* Flux through Hemispers
  * \[ \phi_{2R} = \phi_R = \frac{ 1}{ 2} \frac{ q}{ \varepsilon_0}\]
* Flux through Plane
  * \[ \phi_{Plane} = 0\]
* Surface Area of a Hemisphere
  * \[ A_{hemisphere} = 2 \pi r^2\]


## Gauss' Law
* Gauss' Law
  * \[\oint\limits_{surface}{ \vec E \cdot d \vec A} = \frac{ q_{enclosed}}{ \varepsilon_0}\]
     * The toatal flux is the total charge enclosed over varepsilon not.
  * Inside a spherical surface 
     * \[ Flux = \frac{ Q}{ \varepsilon_0} \]
     * True for all surfaces
  * Outside a spherical surface
     * \[ Flux = 0\]
     * True for all surfaces

## Question 2

[[images/prelecture_03_question_2.png]]

Three point charges are fixed at the vertices of an equilateral triangle of 
side \[d\] as shown. Two of the charges are positive (\[+1 \mu C\] and \[+2 \mu C\]) 
and one is negative (\[-1 \mu C\]). Consider a sphere of radius \[R = \frac{ d}{ 2}\]
centered on the equilateral triangle as shown. What is the sign of the total electric 
flux through this sphere produced by the fields of the three charges?

* The flux is zero.
  * The flux through the sphere is zero since the enclosed charge is zero; all charges 
    are outside of the sphere. All field lines that leave one of the positive charges 
    and enter the sphere at one point must leave the sphere at another point. The 
    contribution to the flux is negative at the entry point and positive at the exit 
    point. The situation is just the reverse for the negative charge. The flux through 
    the sphere is totally determined by the charges inside the sphere. Here there are 
    none; consequently, the flux through the sphere is zero.

## Infinite Line of Charge Example
* Infinite Line of Charge
  * \[ E = 2\kappa \frac{\lambda }{ r} \]
  * \[ E = \frac{ 1}{ 2 \pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{ \lambda}{ r}\]

## Question 3

Consider the electric field lines shown below, produced by two point charges, one positive 
and one negative. Let \[E_A\], \[E_B\], and \[E_C\] denote the magnitudes of the electric 
fields at points \[A\], \[B\], and \[C\], respectively. Which of the following statements 
correctly ranks the strengths of the fields at these points?

[[images/prelecture_03_question_3.png]]

* \[E_C > E_B > E_A \]
  * In the fieldline picture, the magnitude of the field is represented by the density 
    (i.e. closeness) of the field lines. In the example shown, the field lines are most 
    dense at point \[C\] and least dense at point \[A\]. Consequently, \[E_C > E_B > E_A \].
