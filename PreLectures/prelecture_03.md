# Electric Flux and Field Lines

## Overview
* Gauss' Law
  * Inside a spherical surface 
     * \[ Flux = \frac{ Q}{ \epsilon_0} \]
  * Outside a spherical surface
     * \[ Flux = 0\]

## Electric Field Lines

* Electric Field
  * \[ E = \kappa \frac{ q}{ r^2}\]
       * \[ E = \frac{ 1}{ 4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{ q}{ r^2}\]
* Density of Field Lines
  * \[ D = \frac{ N}{4 \pi r^2}\]
     * \[ N \equiv \frac{ q}{ \epsilon_0}\]
     * \[ E = \frac{ N}{ 4 \pi r^2}\]
* Surface Area of a Sphere
  * \[ A = 4 \pi r^2\]

## Electric Flux
* Electric Flux
  * \[ \phi = \vec E \cdot \vec A\]
  * \[ \phi \equiv \int\limits_{\text{surface}}{ \vec E \cdot d \vec A}\]
  * The quantity the counts the number of field lines that pass 
    through a surface.

## Question 1

Consider the same point charge at the center of two different spherical 
surfaces, one having a radius three times as big as the other as shown below.

Compare the electric flux through each of the spheres.
* The flux through the two spheres is the same
  *  We just learned that for a simple spherical configuration the flux is 
    just the product of the electric field \[E\] with the surface area A of the 
    sphere. Since \[E\] decreases as \[ \frac{ 1}{ R^2}\] and the surface area 
    increases as \[R^2\], their product remains constant. This answer can also 
    be understood in terms of our graphical representation in which the flux 
    is a measure of the number of lines leaving the surface. Clearly, the same 
    number of lines leave the surface of any sphere centered on the charge.

## Flux Example
* Flux through Hemispers
  * \[ \phi_{2R} = \phi_R = \frac{ 1}{ 2} \frac{ q}{ \epsilon_0}\]
* Flux through Plane
  * \[ \phi_{Plane} = 0\]
* Surface Area of a Hemisphere
  * \[ A_{hemisphere} = 2 \pi r^2\]


## Gauss' Law
* Gauss' Law
  * \[\oint\limits_{surface}{ \vec E \cdot d \vec A} = \frac{ q_{enclosed}}{ \epsilon_0}\]
     * The toatal flux is the total charge enclosed over epsilon not.
  * Inside a spherical surface 
     * \[ Flux = \frac{ Q}{ \epsilon_0} \]
     * True for all surfaces
  * Outside a spherical surface
     * \[ Flux = 0\]
     * True for all surfaces

## Question 2

Three point charges are fixed at the vertices of an equilateral triangle of 
side \[d\] as shown. Two of the charges are positive (\[+1 \mu C\] and \[+2 \mu C\]) 
and one is negative (\[-1 \mu C\]). Consider a sphere of radius \[R = \frac{ d}{ 2} 
centered on the equilateral triangle as shown. What is the sign of the total electric 
flux through this sphere produced by the fields of the three charges?
