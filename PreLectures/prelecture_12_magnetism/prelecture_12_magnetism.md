# Magnetism

## Overview
* start wit observations about
  * bar magnets
  * compass needles
  * current caring wires
* Well see that magnetic effects can be described 
  by another vector field, appropriately name the 
  magnetic field, that is created by electric charges
  in motion.
* First will we asses the forces magnetic fields have on
  charged particles.
  * Larentz Force \[\vec F = q \vec E + q \vec v \times \vec B\]
      * The general equation which describes the force on a charged
        particle as it moves through regions containing electric and
        magnetic fields.
* We finish by examining a few examples.

## Magnetic Observations
* Bar Magnet
  * [[bar_mag.png]]
  * the ends are usually called the _Nort_ and _South_ poles
  * opposite poles attract
  * like poles repel
  * filed around a bar magnet is similar to an electric dipole
      * [[mag_field.png]]
      * note the triangles in the field represent compass needles
        small bar magnets able to piviot about their central axis
        and align with the field in their proximity
  * if a bar magnet is cut in half you end up with two bar magnets,
    _not_ isolated north and south poles.

## Question 1
We have just discussed what most of you have known since 
elementary school - that the north pole of one magnet is 
attracted to the south pole of another magnet. We also know 
that the needle of a compass is itself a magnet. In view of 
this, how can we explain that the north pole of a compass 
needle seems to be attracted to the north pole of the planet Earth?

* The geographic North pole of the earth is actually the South 
  magnetic pole of the Earth.

## Source of Magnetic Field
* Electric Currents create magnetic fields

  * [[some_current_magnetic_field_1.png]]
* all electric fields are created by charges in motion. 
* Passing a current through a wire produces magnetic field
  and you see according forces between them
  * [[wire_mag_field.png]]
      * same direction produces attractive force
  * [[wire_mag_field_1.png]]
    * opposite direction produces repulsive force

## Magnetic Force
* Just saw two wires create an electric force on one another
* We find that the magnetic field around a wire is always perpendicular
  to the wire and in a clockwise or counter clockwise direction.
  * [[mag_force_field_wire.png]]
* This indicates to us that
  * Force is perpendicular to current 
      * \[\vec F \perp \vec I\] and \[\vec F \perp \vec B\]
          * Both to the direction of the current and the 
            direction of the magnetic field.
  * Cross product is a good mathematical model for this
      * [[charge_mag_field.png]]
      * \[\vec F = q \vec v \times \vec B\]
