# Magnetism

## Overview
* start wit observations about
  * bar magnets
  * compass needles
  * current caring wires
* Well see that magnetic effects can be described 
  by another vector field, appropriately name the 
  magnetic field, that is created by electric charges
  in motion.
* First will we asses the forces magnetic fields have on
  charged particles.
  * Larentz Force \[\vec F = q \vec E + q \vec v \times \vec B\]
      * The general equation which describes the force on a charged
        particle as it moves through regions containing electric and
        magnetic fields.
* We finish by examining a few examples.

## Magnetic Observations
* Bar Magnet
  * [[bar_mag.png]]
  * the ends are usually called the _Nort_ and _South_ poles
  * opposite poles attract
  * like poles repel
  * filed around a bar magnet is similar to an electric dipole
      * [[mag_field.png]]
      * note the triangles in the field represent compass needles
        small bar magnets able to piviot about their central axis
        and align with the field in their proximity
  * if a bar magnet is cut in half you end up with two bar magnets,
    _not_ isolated north and south poles.

## Question 1
We have just discussed what most of you have known since 
elementary school - that the north pole of one magnet is 
attracted to the south pole of another magnet. We also know 
that the needle of a compass is itself a magnet. In view of 
this, how can we explain that the north pole of a compass 
needle seems to be attracted to the north pole of the planet Earth?

* The geographic North pole of the earth is actually the South 
  magnetic pole of the Earth.
