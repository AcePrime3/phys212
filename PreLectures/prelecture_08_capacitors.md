## Parallel-plate Capacitor
* Last time
  * \[C \equiv \frac{ Q}{ \Delta V} = \frac{ Q}{ Ed} = \frac{ Q}{ \frac{ \sigma}{ \varepsilon_0} d} = \frac{ Q}{ \frac{ Q}{ \varepsilon_0 A} d} = \frac{ \varepsilon_0 A}{ d}\]

* if \[d\] increases
  * \[Q\] remains constant
  * \[E = \frac{ \sigma}{ \varepsilon_0}\] remains constant
  * \[\Delta V = - \int{ \vec E \cdot d \vec l} = E d\] increases
  * \[C = \frac{ Q}{ \Delta V} = \frac{ \varepsilon_0 A}{ d}\] decreases
  * \[U\] increases
      * \[W_{byField}\] is negative
      * \[\Delta U = - W_{byField}\] is positve


## Question 1
Two parallel plates have length \[a\] and width \[b\] and are separated by 
\[a\] distance \[d\] (which is much smaller than \[a\] and \[b\]). If all 
of the dimensions are doubled, how does the capacitance of the system change?

* The capacitance increases by a factor of 2
  * The capacitance of a parallel-plate system is proportional to the area 
    of the plates divided by the distance between them, which in this case 
    equals \[\frac{ a b}{ d}\]. If \[a\], \[b\] and \[d\] are all doubled 
    this becomes \[ \frac{ 2 a 2 b}{ 2d} = \frac{ 2 a b}{ d}\], which is twice 
    as big as before.
