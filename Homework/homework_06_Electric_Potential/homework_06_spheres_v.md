# Spheres V

[[spheres_v.png]]

A solid metal sphere of radius \[a = 2.5 cm\] has a net charge 
\[Q_{in} = - 3.0 n C. The sphere is surrounded by a concentric conducting 
spherical shell of inner radius \[b = 6.0 cm\] and outer radius \[c = 9.0 cm\].
The shell has a net charge \[Q_{out} = \[+ 2.0 nC\]. What is \[V_0\], the electric 
potential at the center of the metal sphere, given the potential at infinity is zero? 

* Given
  * \[\vec E( r) = -\frac{ d v}{ d r} \hat r \] 
  * 
* Hints
  * \[V = kQ/r\] cannot be used directly here. We need to start with an expression for \[V\] which is always true.
      * Despite the spherical symmetery, since we are interested in the potential inside 
        the charge distribution, we cannot use \[V = k \frac{ Q}{ r}. 

* \[V_0 =\]
