## Point Charges in One Dimension

A point chare \[q_1 = -3.4 \mu C \] is located at the origin of a coordinate system.
Another point charge \[q_2 = 6.6 \mu C\] is located along the \[x\]-axis at a distance
\[x_2 = 9.5 cm\] from \[q_1\].

### 1)

What is \[F_{12}_x\], the value of the \[x\] component of the force that \[q_1\] exerts on \[q_2\]?

* \[F_{ij} = \kappa \frac{ q_i q_j}{ r^2} \hat r\]
* Let
  * \[q_1 = -3.4 \mu C\]
  * \[q_2 = 6.7 \mu C \]
  * \[r = 9.5 cm = .095 m\]

* \[F_{q_1 q_2}_x = \kappa \frac{ q_1 q_2}{ x_2^2}\]
