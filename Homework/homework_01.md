## Point Charges in One Dimension

A point chare \[q_1 = -3.4 \mu C \] is located at the origin of a coordinate system.
Another point charge \[q_2 = 6.6 \mu C\] is located along the \[x\]-axis at a distance
\[x_2 = 9.5 cm\] from \[q_1\].

### 1)

What is \[F_{12,x}\], the value of the \[x\] component of the force that \[q_1\] exerts on \[q_2\]?

* \[F_{ij} = \kappa \frac{ q_i q_j}{ r^2} \hat r\]
  * \[ \kappa = \frac{ 1}{ 4 \pi \epsilon_0} = 8.99 \times 10^9 \frac{ Nm^2}{ C^2} \]
  * \[ \mu = 10^{-6}\]
* Let:
  * \[q_1 = q_i = -3.4 \mu C\]
  * \[q_2 = q_j = 6.7 \mu C \]
  * \[r = 9.5 cm = .095 m\]


* \[F_{ij,x} = \kappa \frac{ q_i q_j}{ r^2}\]
  * \[ \kappa \frac{ (-3.4)(6.7) \mu^2}{ .095^2} = -22.6917 N\]
     * I don't know why but this is incorrect.

Charge \[q_2\] is now displaced a distance \[y_2 = 2.9 cm\] in the positive \[y\]-direction. What is 
the new value for the \[x\]-component of the force that \[q_1\] exerts on \[q_2\]?

* \[F_{ij} = \kappa \frac{ q_i q_j}{ r^2} \hat r\]
  * \[ \kappa = \frac{ 1}{ 4 \pi \epsilon_0} = 8.99 \times 10^9 \frac{ Nm^2}{ C^2} \]
  * \[ \mu = 10^{-6}\]
* Let:
  * \[q_1 = q_i = -3.4 \mu C\]
  * \[q_2 = q_j = 6.7 \mu C \]
  * \[x_2 = x = 9.5 cm = .095 m\]
  * \[y_2 = y = 2.9 cm = .029 m\]
  * \[r = \sqrt{ x^2 + y^2} = .09932774 m\]
  * \[\theta_{xr} = \arctan{ \left( \frac{ x}{ y} \right)} = 16.9755 \degree\]
