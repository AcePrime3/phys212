## Point Charges in One Dimension

A point chare \[q_1 = -3.4 \mu C \] is located at the origin of a coordinate system.
Another point charge \[q_2 = 6.6 \mu C\] is located along the \[x\]-axis at a distance
\[x_2 = 9.5 cm\] from \[q_1\].

### 1)

What is \[F_{12}_x\], the value of the \[x\] component of the force that \[q_1\] exerts on \[q_2\]?

* \[F_{ij} = \kappa \frac{ q_i q_j}{ r^2} \hat r\]
  * \[ \kappa = \frac{ 1}{ 4 \pi \epsilon_0} = 8.99 \times 10^9 \frac{ Nm^2}{ C^2} \]
* Let:
  * \[q_1 = q_i = -3.4 \mu C\]
  * \[q_2 = q_j = 6.7 \mu C \]
  * \[r = 9.5 cm = .095 m\]


* \[F_{ij}_x = \kappa \frac{ q_i q_j}{ r^2}\]
