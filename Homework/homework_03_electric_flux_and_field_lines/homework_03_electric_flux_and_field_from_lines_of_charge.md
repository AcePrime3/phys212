# Electric Flux and Field from Lines of Charge

An infinite line of charge with charge density 
\[\lambda_1 = -2.0 \mu C/cm\] is aligned with 
the \[y\]-axis as shown.

## 1)
What is \[E_x( P)\], the value of the \[x\]-component 
of the electric field produced by by the line of charge 
at point \[P\] which is located at \[(x,y) = (a,0)\], 
where \[a = 9.5 cm\]?

* \[E_x( P) = 2 k \frac{ \lambda}{ r} = -3.78526 \times 10^7\]
  * \[\lambda_1 = -2.0 \mu C/cm = -200 \mu C/m\]
  * \[a = .095 m\]
