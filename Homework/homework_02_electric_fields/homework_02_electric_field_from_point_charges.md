# Electric Field from Point Charges

Two point charges \[q_1 = -4.1 \mu C\] and \[q_2 = 7.7 \mu C\]
are fixed along the \[x\]-axis, separated by a distance \[ r = 0.095 m\]. 
Point \[P\] is located at \[(x,y) = (d,d)\].

* Let
  * \[q_1 = -4.1 \mu C\]
  * \[q_2 = 7.7 \mu C\]
  * \[d = 0.095 m\]
  * \[P = (d, d)\]
* Given
  * \[E = k \frac{ Q}{ r^2}\]
      * For point charges

## 1)
What is \[E_x( P)\], the value of the \[x\]-component of the electric field 
produced by \[q_1\] and \[q_2\] at point \[P\]?

* Let
  * \[r = \[\sqrt{ 2 d^2}\]
  * \[\theta = 45\]
* \[E_x( P) = k \frac{ q_1}{ r^2} \cos{ (\theta)} 
    = k \frac{ q_1}{ d^2} \cos{ (\theta)} = -1.44395 \times 10^6\]

## 2)
What is \[E_y( P)\], the value of the \[y\]-component of the electric field 
produced by \[q_1\] and \[q_2\] at point \[P\]?

* \[E_x( P) = k \left(\frac{ q_1}{ 2d^2} \sin{ (\theta)}\right) + \frac{ q_2}{ d^2} = 6.22619 \times 10^6\]
  * remember \[q_1\] is negative.

A third point charge \[q_3 = 2.3 \mu C\] is now positioned along the \[y\]-axis 
at a distance \[d = 0.095 m\] from \[q_1\] as shown. What is \[E_x( P)\], the \[x\]-component 
of the field produced by all three charges at point \[P\]?

* Let
  * \[q_1 = -4.1 \mu C\]
  * \[q_2 = 7.7 \mu C\]
  * \[q_3 = 2.3 \mu C\]
  * \[d = 0.095 m\]
  * \[P = (d, d)\]
* Given
  * \[E = k \frac{ Q}{ r^2}\]
      * For point charges

* \[ E_x( P) = k \left(\frac{ q_1}{ 2d^2} \cos{ (\theta)} + \frac{ q_3}{ d^2}\right) = 847133\]

## 4)
Suppose all charges are now doubled (i.e., \[\hat q_1 = 2 q_1 = -8.2 \mu C\], \[\hat q_2 = 2 q_2 = 15.4 \mu C\], \[\hat q_3 = 2 q_3 = 4.6 \mu C\]), how will the electric field at \[P\] change?

* \[ E_x( P) = \sqrt{ \left(k \left(\frac{ 2 q_1}{ 2d^2} \cos{ (\theta)} + \frac{ 2 q_3}{ d^2}\right)\right)^2 + \left(k \left(\frac{ 2 q_1}{ 2d^2} \sin{ (\theta)} + \frac{ 2 q_2}{ d^2}\right)\right)^2}\]
