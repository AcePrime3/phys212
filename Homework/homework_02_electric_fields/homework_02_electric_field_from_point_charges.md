# Electric Field from Point Charges

Two point charges \[q_1 = -4.1 \mu C\] and \[q_2 = 7.7 \mu C\]
are fixed along the \[x\]-axis, separated by a distance \[ r = 0.095 m\]. 
Point \[P\] is located at \[(x,y) = (r,r)\].

* Let
  * \[q_1 = -4.1 \mu C\]
  * \[q_2 = 7.7 \mu C\]
  * \[d = 0.095 m\]
  * \[P = (r,r)\]
* Given
  * \[E = k \frac{ Q}{ r^2}\]
      * For point charges

## 1)
What is \[E_x( P)\], the value of the \[x\]-component of the electric field 
produced by \[q_1\] and \[q_2\] at point \[P\]?

* Let
  * \[r = \[\sqrt{ 2 d^2}\]
  * \[\theta = 45\]
* \[E_x( P) = k \frac{ q_1}{ r^2} \cos{ (\theta)} 
    = k \frac{ q_1}{ d^2} \cos{ (\theta)} = -1.44395 \times 10^6\]

## 2)
What is \[E_y( P)\], the value of the \[y\]-component of the electric field 
produced by \[q_1\] and \[q_2\] at point \[P\]?

* \[E_x( P) = k \left(\frac{ q_2}{ d^2} - \frac{ q_1}{ r^2} \sin{ (\theta)}\right)\]
