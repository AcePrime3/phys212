# Electric Field from Point Charges

Two point charges (\[q_1 = -4.1 \mu C\] and \[q_2 = 7.7 \mu C\]) 
are fixed along the \[x\]-axis, separated by a distance \[ r = d = 0.095 m\]. 
Point \[P\] is located at \[(x,y) = (r,r)\].

What is \[E_x( P)\], the value of the \[x\]-component of the electric field 
produced by \[q_1\] and \[q_2\] at point \[P\]?
