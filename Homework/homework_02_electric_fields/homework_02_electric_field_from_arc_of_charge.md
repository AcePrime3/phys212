# Electric Field from Arc of Charge
A total charge \[Q = -2.0 \mu C\] is distributed 
uniformly over a quarter circle arc of radius \[a = .095 m\] as shown.

## 1)

What is \[\lambda\] the linear charge density along the arc?

* \[2 \pi r\]
  * Circumfrerence
* Let
  * \[ r = a = .095 m\]

* \[\lambda = \frac{ k \frac{ Q}{ r^2}}{  \frac{ 1}{ 2} \pi r}\]
  * It says I made a power of ten error, what I am doing wrong?

# 2)
What is \[E_x\], the value of the \[x\]-component of the electric field at the origin \[(x, y) = (0,0)\] ?

\[E_x = k Q \int\limits_{ 0}^{ \frac{ \pi}{ 2}}{ \frac{ Q}{ r} \cos{ (\theta)} d \theta}\]
