# Electric Field from Arc of Charge
A total charge \[Q = -2.0 \mu C\] is distributed 
uniformly over a quarter circle arc of radius \[a = .095 m\] as shown.

## 1)

What is \[\lambda\] the linear charge density along the arc?

* \[2 \pi r\]
  * Circumfrerence
* Let
  * \[ r = a = .095 m\]

* \[\lambda = \frac{ k \frac{ Q}{ r^2}}{  \frac{ 1}{ 2} \pi r}\]
