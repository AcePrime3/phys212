# Homework: Kirchoff's Rules

## Current Div
The circuit above contains 5 resistors \[R_1, R_2, R_A, R_B, R_C\] 
with equal resistance \[R\]. Write an equation for the current \[i_2\] 
in terms of the current \[i_1\]. ( when entering your answer, use 
i1 for \[i_1\], e.g., the answer 0.5*i1 has the correct syntax)

* \[I_2 = \frac{ 1}{ 3} I_1\]
