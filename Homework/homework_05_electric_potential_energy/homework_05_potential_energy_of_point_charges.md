# Potential Energy of Point Charges
A point charge \[q_2 = -3.2 \mu C\] is fixed at the origin of 
a co-ordinate system as shown. Another point charge \[q_1 = 2.5 \mu C\] 
is is initially located at point \[P\], a distance \[d_1 = 9.3 cm\] from 
the origin along the \[x\]-axis

What is \[\Dleta U_{P R}\], the change in potenial energy of charge \[q_1\] when 
it is moved from point \[P\] to point \[R\], located a distance \[d_2 = 3.7 cm\]
 from the origin along the \[x\]-axis as shown?

* Given 
  * \[\vec F_E = \frac{ 1}{ 4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{ Q q}{ r^2}\hat{ r} \rightarrow \Delta U_{A B} = \frac{ Q q}{ 4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \left(\frac{ 1}{ r_B} - \frac{ 1}{ r_A}\right)\]

* Let
  * \[q_1 = 2.5 \mu C\]
  * \[q_2 = -3.2 \mu C\]
  * \[d_1 = 9.3 cm = .093 m\]
  * \[d_2 = 3.7 cm = .037 m\]

* \[\Delta U_{P R} 
  = \frac{ q_1 q_2}{ 4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \left(\frac{ 1}{ d_2} - \frac{ 1}{ d_1}\right)
  = -1.17069\]

The charge \[q_2\] is now replaced by two charges \[q_3\] and \[q_4\] which each have a magnitude 
of \[-1.6 \mu C\], half of that of \[q_2\]. The charges are located a distance \[a = 2.2 cm\] 
from the oringin along the \[y\]-axis as shown. What is \[\Delta U_{P R}\], the change in potential 
energy now if charge \[q_1\] is moved from point \[P\] to point \[R\]?


* Given 
  * \[\vec F_E = \frac{ 1}{ 4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{ Q q}{ r^2}\hat{ r} \rightarrow \Delta U_{A B} = \frac{ Q q}{ 4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \left(\frac{ 1}{ r_B} - \frac{ 1}{ r_A}\right)\]

* Let
  * \[q_1 = 2.5 \mu C\]
  * \[q_3 = -1.6 \mu C\]
  * \[q_4 = -1.6 \mu C\]
  * \[d_1 = 9.3 cm = .093 m\]
  * \[d_2 = 3.7 cm = .037 m\]
  * \[a = 2.2 cm = .022 m\]
  * \[\theta_P = \arctan{ \left(\frac{ a}{ d_1}\right)}\]
  * \[\theta_R = \arctan{ \left(\frac{ a}{ d_2}\right)}\]


* \[\Delta U_{P R} 
  = \left(\frac{ q_1 q_2}{ 4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \left(\frac{ 1}{ d_2}\right) \cos{ (\theta_P)\right)
  = -1.17069\]
