# Potential Energy of Point Charges
A point charge \[q_2 = -3.2 \mu C\] is fixed at the origin of 
a co-ordinate system as shown. Another point charge \[q_1 = 2.5 \mu C\] 
is is initially located at point \[P\], a distance \[d_1 = 9.3 cm\] from 
the origin along the \[x\]-axis

## 1)
What is \[\Dleta PE\], the change in potenial energy of charge \[q_1\] when 
it is moved from point \[P\] to point \[R\], located a distance \[d_2 = 3.7 cm\]
 from the origin along the \[x\]-axis as shown?
