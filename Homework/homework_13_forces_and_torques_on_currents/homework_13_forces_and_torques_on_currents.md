# Homework: Forces and Torques on Currents

## Loop Work

A wire formed in the shape of an equilateral triangle of side $d = 8.0 cm$, 
carries current $i = 0.25 A$. This loop is located in a region of space that 
contains a constant magnetic field of magnitude $B = 1.3 T$, aligned with the 
negative z-axis as shown in the diagram below.

What is \[W_{I to II}\], the work you would have to do to rotate the coil 180Â° from 
Position I to Position II? (Note, the coil is rotated out of the plane of 
the page, not simply spun in the plane) 

\[W_{I to II} =\]
