# Three Charges

[[images/homework_01_three_cherges.png]]

Three charges are fixed in place as shown. The squares in the 
grid have sides of length \[s = 0.24 m\]. The magnitude of \[q\] is 
\[3.0 \mu C\], while the magnitude of \[Q\] is \[4.5 \mu C\]. What 
is the magnitude of the net force on q due to the other two charges?
