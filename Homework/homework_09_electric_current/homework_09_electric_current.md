# Homework: Electric Current

## Circuit 1 with Resistor and a Battery

A circuit is constructed with five resistors and a battery as shown. 
The battery voltage is \[V = 12.0 V\]. The values for the resistors 
are: \[R_1 = 75.0 \Omega\], \[R_2 = 118.0 \Omega\], \[R_3 = 147.0 \Omega\]
and \[R_4 = 61.0 \Omega\].

The value for \[R_X\] is unknown, but it is known that \[I_4\], 
the current that flows through resistor \[R_4\], is zero.

* \[V = 12.0 V\]
* \[R_1 = 75.0 \Omega\] 
* \[R_2 = 118.0 \Omega\] 
* \[R_3 = 147.0 \Omega\]
* \[R_4 = 61.0 \Omega\]. 
* \[I_4 = 0\]

### 1)
What is \[I_1\], the magnitude of the current that flows through the resistor \[R_1\]?
