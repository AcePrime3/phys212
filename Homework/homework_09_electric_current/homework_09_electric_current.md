# Homework: Electric Current

## Circuit 1 with Resistor and a Battery

A circuit is constructed with five resistors and a battery as shown. 
The battery voltage is \[V = 12.0 V\]. The values for the resistors 
are: \[R_1 = 75.0 \Omega\], \[R_2 = 118.0 \Omega\], \[R_3 = 147.0 \Omega\]
and \[R_4 = 61.0 \Omega\].

The value for \[R_X\] is unknown, but it is known that \[I_4\], 
the current that flows through resistor \[R_4\], is zero.

* \[V = 12.0 V\]
* \[R_1 = 75.0 \Omega\] 
* \[R_2 = 118.0 \Omega\] 
* \[R_3 = 147.0 \Omega\]
* \[R_4 = 61.0 \Omega\]. 
* \[I_4 = 0\]

### 1)
What is \[I_1\], the magnitude of the current that flows through the resistor \[R_1\]?

* \[I = I_1 + I_2\]
  * \[I_b = I_1 + I_2\]
  * \[V_b = V_1 = V_2\]
  * \[I_b = \frac{ V_b}{ R_1} + \frac{ V_b}{ R_2}\]
  * \[ p\]

* \[\frac{ v}{ R_1}\]
  * It looks like you have calculated the current assuming that 
    the voltage across \[R_1\] is the battery voltage, which it 
    is not. The current does not return directly to the battery 
    after leaving \[R_1\]. Where does it go before returning to 
    the battery?
