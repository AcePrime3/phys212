# Point Charges in Two Dimensions

Three charges (\[q_1 = 5.9 \mu C, q_2 = -4.3 \mu C, and q_3 = 3.6 \muC\]) 
are located at the vertices of an equilateral triangle with 
side \[d = 9.5 cm\] as shown.

## 1)

 What is \[F_{3,x}\], the value of the \[x\]-component of the net force on \[q_3\]?


## 2)

What is \[F_{3,y}\], the value of the \[y\]-component of the net force on \[q_3\]?

## 3)

A charge \[q_4 = 3.6 \mu C\] is now added as shown.

What is \[F_{2,x}\], the \[x\]-component of the new net force on \[q_2\]?

## 4)

What is \[F_{2,y}\], the \[y\]-component of the new net force on \[q_2\]?

## 5)

What is \[F_{1,x}\], the \[x\]-component of the new net force on \[q_1\]?

## 6)

How would you change \[q_1\] (keeping \[q_2\], \[q_3\] and \[q_4\] fixed) in order to make the net force on \[q_2\] equal to zero?
