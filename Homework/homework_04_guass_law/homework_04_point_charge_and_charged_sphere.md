# Point Charge and Charged Sphere

A point charge \[q_1 = -8.5 \mu C\] is located at the center 
of a thick conducting shell of inner radius \[a = 2.8 cm\] 
and outer radius \[b = 4.1 cm\], The conducting shell has 
a net charge of \[q_2 = 2.1 \mu C\].

## 1)
What is \[E_x( P)\], the value of the \[x\]-component of 
the electric field at point \[P\], located a distance \[7.3 cm\] 
along the \[x\]-axis from \[q_1\]?

* Let
  * \[q_1 = -8.5 \mu C\]
    * point charge at the center
  * \[q_2 = 2.1 \mu C\]
    * net charge of the conducting shell
  * \[a = 2.8 cm = 0.028\]
    * inner radius of the conducting shell
  * \[b = 4.1 cm = 0.041 m\]
    * outer radius of the conducting shell
