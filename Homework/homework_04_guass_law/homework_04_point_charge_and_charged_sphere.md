# Point Charge and Charged Sphere

A point charge \[q_1 = -8.5 \mu C\] is located at the center 
of a thick conducting shell of inner radius \[a = 2.8 cm\] 
and outer radius \[b = 4.1 cm\], The conducting shell has 
a net charge of \[q_2 = 2.1 \mu C\].

## 1)
What is \[E_x( P)\], the value of the \[x\]-component of 
the electric field at point \[P\], located a distance \[7.3 cm\] 
along the \[x\]-axis from \[q_1\]?

* Given
  * \[E = k \frac{ Q}{ r^2}\]
      * Electric field of a point charge
* Let
  * \[q_1 = -8.5 \mu C\]
      * point charge at the center
  * \[q_2 = 2.1 \mu C\]
      * net charge of the conducting shell
  * \[a = 2.8 cm = 0.028\]
      * inner radius of the conducting shell
  * \[b = 4.1 cm = 0.041 m\]
      * outer radius of the conducting shell
  * \[r = 7.3 cm = 0.073 m\]
* \[E_x( P) = k \left(\frac{ q_1 + q_2}{ r^2}\right) = -1.07968 \times 10^7\]

## 2)
What is \[E_y( P)\], the value of the \[y\]-component of the electric 
field at point \[P\], located a distance \[7.3 cm\] along the \[x\]-axis 
from \[q_1\]?

* \[E_y( P)\ = 0\]

## 3)

field at point \[R\], located a distance \[1.4 cm\] along the \[y\]-axis 
from \[q_1\]?

* \[E_x( R) = 0\]

field at point \[R\], located a distance \[1.4 cm\] along the \[y\]-axis 
from \[q_1\]?
* Given
  * \[E = k \frac{ Q}{ r^2}\]
      * Electric field of a point charge
* Let
  * \[q_1 = -8.5 \mu C\]
