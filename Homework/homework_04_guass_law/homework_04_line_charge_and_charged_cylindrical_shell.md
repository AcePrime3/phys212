# Line Charge and Charged Cylindrical Shell
An infinite line of charge with linear density 
\[\lambda_1 = 6.9 \mu \frac{ C}{ m}\] is positioned along 
the axis of a thick insulating shell of inner radius 
\[a = 2.5 cm\] and outer radius \[b = 4.8 cm\]. The 
insulating shell is uniformly charged with a volume density of 
\[\rho   = -665.0 \mu \frac{ C}{ m^3}\].
