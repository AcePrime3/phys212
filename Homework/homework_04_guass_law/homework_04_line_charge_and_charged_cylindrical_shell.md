# Line Charge and Charged Cylindrical Shell
An infinite line of charge with linear density 
\[\lambda_1 = 6.9 \mu \frac{ C}{ m}\] is positioned along 
the axis of a thick insulating shell of inner radius 
\[a = 2.5 cm\] and outer radius \[b = 4.8 cm\]. The 
insulating shell is uniformly charged with a volume density of 
\[\rho   = -665.0 \mu \frac{ C}{ m^3}\].

## 1)
What is \[\lambda_2\], the linear charge density of the insulating shell?

* Given
  * \[E = \frac{ \lambda}{ 2 \pi \varepsilon_0 r}\]
      * where \[\lambda \Rightarrow\] liniear charge density
  * \[\rho = \frac{ Q}{ 4 \pi r^2}\]
* Let
  * \[a = 2.5 cm = 0.025 m\]
    * inner radius of the insulating shell
  * \[b = 4.8 cm = 0.048 m\]
    * outer radius of the insulating shell
  * \[\rho   = -665.0 \mu \frac{ C}{ m^3}\]
    * insulating shell

## 2)
What is \[E_x( P)\], the value of the \[x\]-component of the electric 
field at point \[P\], located a distance \[8.2 cm\] along the \[y\]-axis 
from the line of charge?
