An insulator in the shape of a spherical shell is shown in cross-section above. 
The insulator is defined by an inner radius \[a = 4.0 cm\] and an outer radius 
\[b = 6.0 cm\] and carries a total charge of \[Q = + 9.0 \mu C\]. (You may 
assume that the charge is distributed uniformly throughout the volume of 
the insulator). What is \[E_y\], the \[y\]-component of the electric field at point 
\[P\] which is located at \[(x,y) = (0 m, -5.0 cm)\] as shown in the diagram?

* Let
  * \[a = 4.0 cm = 0.04 m\]
  * \[b = 6.0 cm = 0.06 m\]
  * \[Q = 9.0 \mu C\]
  * \[(x, y) = (0 m, -5.0 cm) = (0 m, -0.05 m) = \]
* Given
  * For sphical insulators with a point charge \[Q\] at the center:
    * \[E = \frac{ Q}{ 4 \pi \varepsilon_0 r^2}\]
  * \[V_sphere =  \frac{ 4}{ 3} \pi r^3\]
* \[E_y = \frac{ \frac{ Q}{ 4 \pi \varepsilon_0 r^2}}{ V_{sphere_b} - V_{sphere_a}}\]
