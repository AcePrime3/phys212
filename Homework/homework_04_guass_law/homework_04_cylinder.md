# Cylinder

[[cylinder.png]]

Two coaxial cylindrical conductors are shown in perspective and cross-section above. 
The inner cylinder has radius \[a = 2.0 cm\], length \[L = 10.0 m\] and carries a 
total charge of \[Q_{inner} = + 8.0 nC\] where \[1 nC = 10-9 C\]. The outer cylinder 
has an inner radius \[b = 6.0 cm\], outer radius \[c = 7.0 cm\], length \[L = 10.0 m\] 
and carries a total charge of \[Q_{outer} = - 16.0 nC\] . What is \[E_x\], the 
\[x\]-component of the electric field at point P which is located at the midpoint of 
the length of the cylinders at a distance \[r = 4.0 cm\] from the origin and makes 
an angle of \[30.0^\circ\] with the \[x\]-axis?
