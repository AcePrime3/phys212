## Homewok: Electric Fields Zero
Two charges are fixed in place on the \[x\]-axis as shown. 
The charge at \[x = 0\] is negative and has magnitude 
\[q = 2.0 \mu C\] (\[1 \mu C = 10^{-6} C\]. The charge at 
\[x = d\], (\[d = +12.0 cm\]), is positive and has magnitude 
\[Q = 4.0 \mu C\]. Find a point \[x = x_o\] along the \[x\]-axis 
at which the electric field is zero.

\[x_o =\]
