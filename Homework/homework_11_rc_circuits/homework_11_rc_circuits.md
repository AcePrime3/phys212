# RC Circuits

## 3r2c
The switch \[S\] in the circuit shown below has been open 
for a long time when, at time \[t = 0\], it is closed. The 
values of the circuit elements are: \[V = 12.0 V, 
R_1 = 110.0 \Omega, R_2 = 220.0 \Omega, R_3 = 330.0 \Omega, 
C_1 = 40.0 \mu F, C_2 = 80.0 \mu F\].

What is \[Q_{2final}\], the charge on \[C_2\] a long time after the switch is closed? 

\[Q_{2final} =\]

* Voltage across a capacitor depends on the charge on the capacitor.
  * \[V_C = \frac{ Q}{ C}\]
* Current goes to zero as the capacitors are charged.
* The charge on the capacitors is equal.
* \[Q_2 = \frac{ \frac{ r_2 V}{  r_1 + r_2}}{ \frac{ 1}{ C_1} + \frac{ 1}{ C_2}}\]
